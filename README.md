Prerequests


Create an account if you don't have on TMDB. Because I use its free API to consume movie/tv data.
And then follow the documentation to create API Key
Finally, if you use v3 of TMDB API, create a file named .env, and copy and paste the content of .env.example. And then paste the API Key you just created.
